# Making Sense Out of Unstructured Patient Data

## Business Understanding
This project aims to analyze unstructured Electronic Medical Records (EMR) data to extract key information such as patient demographics, diagnoses, medications, and vital statistics. The primary goal is to derive meaningful insights from the raw EMR text corpora.

## Data Understanding
The data source is a text file containing unstructured medical records. The chosen dataset was selected for its relevance to diabetes, and the analysis focused on extracting critical health information. Future enhancements may include additional analysis or integration with structured datasets.
